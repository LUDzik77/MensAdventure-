Mr Test Tester is facing Saladin Tuahihi today                    
Can Test-o-steron defeat The bun?

Mr Test Tester <Kata guruma>:
What a beautiful judo throw! He is leading on the scorecard in my opinion

Fight moves to the ground!

Saladin Tuahihi <Heel hook>:
He controls the opponent's knee, it looks like it's all over... No, the opponent has released his leg somehow.

Mr Test Tester <Armbar>:
What a poor technique...

Saladin Tuahihi  has a groundcontrol now!

Saladin Tuahihi <Leglock scramble>:
The opponents leg is trapped!

END OF THE FIGHT
